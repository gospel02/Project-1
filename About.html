        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p class="slogan">Best Quality Burgers in town. Off the charts.</p>
        <p> Come into any <b>ROCKEY BURGERS</b>, and you'll notice we're different. From our famous (free) house-made
                    pickles, to the hand-painted signage, to our cheerful staff, we build our restaurants like we build
                    our burgers-sustainably, locally, and with an unwavering commitment to quality.</p>
        <p>Fresh, quality produce, meat, dairy and buns, sourced from partners located just miles from our
                    restaurants, are the ingredients to making the perfect burger. This commitment to creating the best
                    possible food for our guests is a direct reflection of our promise of creating fast food burgers using
                    slow food values.</p>
        <p id="Red">Bite into any Super burger, and taste the difference. Our burgers, fries, and shakes are made with the
                    finest, freshest ingredients available.</p>
        <p>All our beef is Rockey Farms, humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed, ground fresh daily, and sourced from a
                    family-owned ranch.</p>
        <p>All of our shakes and cones are made with organic cream from Rockey Creamery,a small, family-owned,
                organic farm located South of Nephi, Utah.</p>
        <p>Our buns are baked to our specification by an artisan baker in Nephi, UT</p>
        <p>The potatoes we use to make our French fries are made from potatoes grown in North America by growers
                     who are required to identify the genetic source of their seed potatoes. We do not work with genetically
                    modified potato varieties. Our potatoes are processed fresh off the field and delivered to us without any
                    modifications. We proudly serve Sir Kensington ketchup.</p>
